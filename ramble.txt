Lavinraca was a wild ride for me. 

And nothing captures the experience more, for me, than the Catalyst being a Good Butler and hosting a Slumber Party only for us to move into their bathroom and refuse to leave.

Peak experience.

How often are you in a discord server that's modeled after a physical space, complete with bots keeping people entirely separate unless they are in the same spot?

I have NO idea what else is going on in this game now, because I have decided I live in a single bathroom.

Haven't even done much more than LOOK at the second floor, but this is the end game for me.

And 11 other people agreed!

Isn't that just fun? 

Zampanic, really, when you think about it.

The game is whatever you want it to be. 

Whatever sparks joy, do that, and you're playing the game.

Which you lost, by the way.

You're welcome :) :) :)
