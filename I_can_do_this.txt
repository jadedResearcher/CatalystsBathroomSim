aaaahhh...okay. okay okay okay okay, i think i know what's going on.
i need to sometimes have separate transcript files because the AI program only generates the first x characters as an automatic transcripted file name...
it'll hafta be optional though, because the files i already have don't have separate transcripts.
okay
i can do this
