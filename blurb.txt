<b>JR:</b> why does the catalyst get TWO sinks
<b>prinx_e_umlaut:</b> wait, what does not being in the bathroom have to do with performing capitalism
<b>defensive_lobster:</b> *sits on the closed toilet*
<b>defensive_lobster:</b> Ladies, gentlemen and other specimen. It appears we are stuck.
<b>prinx_e_umlaut:</b> why do you get two sinks<
<b>defensive_lobster:</b> Now, you may be asking, "how in the hell is it possible to get stuck here? The command to leave through the door was right there!"
<b>defensive_lobster:</b> Wellll, the bot is stuck. Just straight up decided the door doesn't exist. So we are, quite literally, stuck in a room with no connections to anywhere in this microcosmos. All we have is a toilet, a shower curtain that can't be moved for some reason? And yes, thank you prinxe, two whole sinks.
<b>defensive_lobster:</b> If anybody has any ideas, please come forth and sit on the throne. *hops off the toilet*
