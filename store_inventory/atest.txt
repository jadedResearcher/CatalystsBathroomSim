I am REALLY enjoying coding up Catalyst's Bathroom Simulator!!!

Just the concept of a file system maze that is a bit more beefy than Gopher feeds me so well. I can hide so much mad science here!

I was feeling a bit weird about how straight forward the current main page of farrago is, this fits the jumbled mess so much better!

To say nothing of how MOST of zampanio is only accessible through three doors, each of which changes where it points based on day.

Of course I'll still probably put the BIG stuff either there or the straightforward, filterable main page. 


But isn't it nice to have a place I can put experiments and mad science and shit posts and tests?

Though, not being able to find things again will be annoying. Still, I can do things like store them in git and deploy them to a maze location, if it really matters.



Anyways, this is my test of the new "store" system. 

I plan for there to be a store in the main entrance to the bathroom, and then scattered about. 

Each store SHOULD have entirely unique offerings, so, keep an eye out :) :) ;)
