My friend Brian said this (and said I could quote):


It was pretty interesting; it didn't really feel quite like teaching any other subject. There was a lot of "zooming in" / "zooming out" that was an unfamiliar process for the kid: alternating between "here is the big thing that I want to happen in the game" and "these are the actual discrete steps that need to happen." It's one of those skills that is so fundamental to programming that it's pretty second-nature to anyone with some experience, but I don't often get to see people who are in the very beginning stages of grappling with the concept.

In general I ask a lot of leading questions when I teach, and I found that I had to do some heavy leading sometimes to get him to think small enough. I might have to go through five or six rounds of questioning to get him from "when the player presses a button, I want the bullet to shoot and when it hits the alien it explodes" to things like "I need to change the y value of the bullet". He got there, though!
