Alya,Hallow and Eve are adorable kittens I adopted in spring 2025 and immediately started turning into spooky (and occasionally cute) sounds and video.

Before I got them MOST of my spooky stuff was , you know, spooky stuff, but now the average spooky thing was originally like, a kitten playing or purring or whatever.

10/10. 

Duncan (pomernanian), Donut (large brown cat (in a corn costume)) and Ender (large silver cat) have all died of old age, but they provided a little bit of images or audio over the years. 

Tina is still alive, as of writing this, and occasionally contributes as well.  

But there's nothing like a kitten for being entertaining, so here we are.




BTW, Hallow has no eyes, and was born around (the shelter claims ON) Halloween. We didn't intend to adopt Eve, but she was his BESTIE at the shelter, her loud breathing (from an illness when she was itty bitty) lets him follow her around and get along with him. 

Alya is... NOT a fan of him. She likes Eve (and even Tina), but she thinks Hallow is rude for bumping into her all the time. We're trying out a bell on her, see if it helps.
