one of the only good pictures of Duncan i could find that LOOKED like him and not some random Pomeranian with fur,...happened to have him in in the kim from disco Elysium pose

and i HAVE a poster of kim

so i got a picture of Duncan the same size and put him underneath kim

and then someone joked i should edit him to make them mixed

they were too small to make a new picture of but i wanted to make SOMETHING with him

he's been gone a little over a month now, and we're starting to look for kittens

I've missed having cats since donut left two years ago but i didn't want anything to take focus from keeping Duncan alive and comfortable, since he's been so sick for so long

i found an eyeless black kitten that looks REALLY cool and the fact that Duncan and Tina have been blind for years made the shelter lady excited about my application for this kitten.

His name is Hallow and they say he was born on Halloween and he's so cool looking. 

i like making horror art (audio and visual) from my pets and i feel torn

on the one hand i don't want to say "disability is horror", obviously

on the other he looks SO COOL like a little void in the world

i think if i DID make any art from him (assuming i get to take him home) it would be ones that emphasized his 'hole in the side of reality' nature and not like, the sutures where his eyes should be?

like, he can't really consent to have his disabilitiy celebrated rather than reviled, i guess is what im thinking? 

i could make art out of a close up of my biopsy scar, for example, but not out of someone *elses* without their consent, is where my head currently is.

but i do find his disability part of his charm (and according to the shelter he has been blind his whole life so he is very much filled with ability)

Duncan and tina went blind from their diabetes, and it was slow and subtle and we got the whole house more blind-animal friendly for them. 

we've been joking that it'll be weird having an animal that can SEE, we're not used to it, and then we find this cool as fuck blind cat

we still probably will get some sighted kittens to be his siblings, the shelter emphasized that blind cats do best with sighted playmates because they can help guide each other

but that'll come after Hallow has had time to settle in

my partner jokes that because we learned blind cats 'see' through their feet (pheromone trails let them know safe places they've been before) we should call him "Vimes", since the terry pratchet watchman famously navigates by his feet as well , but Hallow is already such a cool name. 

So we decided to give Hallow an Epitaph.  Vimes is possessed by the Summoning Dark in the series so.  Hallow, the Summoning Dark seems appropriate. 

we'll get to meet him soon, and it sounds like he's well old enough and healthy enough (he is the healthiest cat ever because they monitored him so much after his operation) to go home with us if we and he seem to agree
