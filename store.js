/*

my first three branches of zampanio were in react because i wanted to get better for my jorb.

regrets.

porting evertying to pure vanilla is my passion now

by which i mean. 

please enjoy this horrible giant god file
*/


//this is. extremely. extremely bad practice.
//but it DOES let me have the styling for the help desk contained within a single file
//which the bathroom sim in PARTICULAR prefers.
//god help future me

so these are clearly seeds
the whole point of seeded randomness is you give it a number (or something you can turn INTO a number (like i used with WIS) and you get unpredicatable outputs
HOWEVER
in a lot of my args
i'll have special seeds or input or whatever
where the randomness resolves and you get a result
now
THIS is DIFFICULT to fully leverage on a website 
because the wastes can just dig into the code and find the special seeds
i got around wthis with the audio log engine
if you get it wrong you get the garbled mess and if you get it right you get the pre-created value
my hypthosis is that this works via giving it a random seed and you get "bot does random comands for 1-10 seconds"
but theres special seeds in this live version that get whatever is going to happen
and doing THAT on a video wouldn't be hacked because theres no website, just a video of it
but also it makes me wanna do an audio log engine that is just numbers not passwords
where the point is "put in a random number for hours and see what you find"
especially if i could port pl's glitch enigne
that would be fun
