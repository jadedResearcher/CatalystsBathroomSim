<b>JR:</b> guys guys guys, check this out
<b>JR:</b> why does the catalyst get TWO sinks
<b>prinx_e_umlaut:</b> wait, what does not being in the bathroom have to do with performing capitalism
<b>defensive_lobster:</b> *sits on the closed toilet*
<b>defensive_lobster:</b> Ladies, gentlemen and other specimen. It appears we are stuck.
<b>prinx_e_umlaut:</b> why do you get two sinks<
<b>defensive_lobster:</b> Now, you may be asking, "how in the hell is it possible to get stuck here? The command to leave through the door was right there!"
<b>defensive_lobster:</b> Wellll, the : is stuck. Just straight up decided the door doesn't exist. So we are, quite literally, stuck in a room with no connections to anywhere in this microcosmos. All we have is a toilet, a shower curtain that can't be moved for some reason? And yes, thank you prinxe, two whole sinks.
<b>defensive_lobster:</b> If anybody has any ideas, please come forth and sit on the throne. *hops off the toilet*
prinx_e_umlaut: *squeezes into the small space between the unmovable curtain and the wall and sits down in the bathtub* Meow.
eldritchcorvus: how the fuck are we stuck? You have a fucking god with you. Watch me punch this wall down
eldritchcorvus:*Crow then goes to try and punch down the wall but despite his godly strength he fails to do anything but break his hand. Screaming in pain as all of it's bones are broken in a comedic slapstick manner*
voldllght:*stands up on the closed toilet*
voldllght: I propose, we dub the shower The Third Sink.
eldritchcorvus:  What. Sure it functions like a sink but larger but why call it a sink when it's purpose is different?
voldllght: I think three sinks would be cool
prinx_e_umlaut: *calls out from behind the curtain* sure, that makes as much sense as anything
prinx_e_umlaut: Meow.
voldllght: Then it is settled. Also I have no damn clue on how we're getting out
eldritchcorvus: Yeah and I'm a god. I just hope it's just a liminal space not any punishment directly at me
eldritchcorvus: *Crow is a anthro dragon of pale skin colored scales. 6 purple eyes and is 7'5. He fits within this room but barley as he has to bend over his 1 foot of dragon neck to stay within the room*
defensive_lobster: I... am glad we're staying occupied with important discussions about sinks and showers. We do have literally all the time in eternity I think? So how about we start asking some questions
defensive_lobster: Such as
defensive_lobster: WHY ARE THERE 20 OF YOU IN MY FUCKING BATHROOM
defensive_lobster: seriously, the sleepover ended TWO WEEKS AGO
prinx_e_umlaut: isnt it obvious? im a cat, i go where i want
voldllght: I liked the curtain color, and was enchanted by its majesty.
un.heimlich: Do any of you have any hamburgers or anything left ðŸ˜­ I think we're running out of food
voldllght: I uh, I ate all my food during the sleepover.
defensive_lobster: FAN-FRICKING-TASTIC
defensive_lobster: On one hand, luckily I don't think we need food, just hydration. And water seems to be mysteriously still running, which gives us a bigger problem: we're gonna go insane sooner than die. YAAAY.
voldllght: Funny of you to assume some of us arent already insane
defensive_lobster: Okay okay calm down, look. Some of us went through gopher before, right? This is just like that, just... in one room. With no way out. Not even exploration to keep us busy, yeah this is fine, hahahahaahahaah. Hah
eldritchcorvus: I'm a god. I also got lost on my way to the elevator
voldllght: We could play eye-spy, Ill go first. I spy with my little eye something white.
defensive_lobster: The bedsheet KR is wearing! Or... wait I think they just ARE a sentient bedsheet.
voldllght: Correct!
eldritchcorvus: There's not a lot of space here and I am unsure if my powers even work here. If I can't get us to escape I would probably try to warp the bathroom larger. Yet there the wall contains no bodies or machines and the walls are unbreakable
un.heimlich: We've gotta be able to get out of here eventually :stressed: right?? :stressed: :stressed: the door will start working again any minute now :stressed: :stressed: :stressed:
jadedResearcher: bold of you to assume talking to each other isn't exploration
eldritchcorvus: I hope so. but then again our fates are known. I just hope this does not become love town
jadedResearcher: infinite branching dialog
defensive_lobster: What do YOU know, you're stuck here just like all of us JR
voldllght: WAIT
voldllght: I brought my laptop
voldllght: we can game
eldritchcorvus: does it have battery?
voldllght: For now, someone find me an outlet. There's usually one in hotel bathrooms for hairdryers and such
un.heimlich: Ooo video game night with the Bathroom Brigade
un.heimlich: Bathroom Bros
un.heimlich: Bathroom Buddies
eldritchcorvus: Uhh... I don't think there's an outlet here. if there was one I would of warped it into a way out. Also if tat thing has batteries you better try to contact the outside with it
un.heimlich: Bathroom bunch...
prinx_e_umlaut: *from behind the shower curtain* you can try sticking the fork in me, i can generate power
voldllght: I would but uh, the only thing I can get to work on this internet is the <a href='http://lavinraca.eyedolgames.com/Week1/' target="_blank">booking</a> site for the hotel
eldritchcorvus: Ok that's strange. Was hoping for an easy escape like that
prinx_e_umlaut: huh. lets see
voldllght: As if we would be so fortunate
prinx_e_umlaut: *phases out and then immediately back in with a garbled sound effect; if anyone were to peek behind the shower curtain, theyd see me being way more frazzled after that*
un.heimlich: What happened? ðŸ˜³
eldritchcorvus: What the- what did you just do?
voldllght: what- what happened, did they do something?
prinx_e_umlaut: hu, ab, vg jnf whfg na vaperqvoyl onq vqrn, hu.
un.heimlich: I see I see
voldllght: That cant be good
eldritchcorvus: *for Crow this is an ancient language as he speaks it back to the cat who once vanished in here Jung qb lbh zrna vg'f na vaperqvoyl onq vgrz?*
voldllght: okay now they are :h doing it

prinx_e_umlaut: gurerf abg ernyyl zhpu ryfr gb fnl
voldllght: Im just, going to see what I can get to work on this internet.
prinx_e_umlaut: *sparks start flying off the cat, one of them making a small, but not tiny, hole in the shower curtain*
un.heimlich: Have you tried seeing if you can contact one of the butlers from the website that aren't in this bathroom? Maybe they can help get us out
voldllght: Yeah, seems to be a no go.
voldllght: I did however get youtube to somewhat work, no comment section, and none of the upload functions seem to work. But we have all of Vsauce.
the1whoscreams: (i approach the door and do something with my hand. it is unclear exactly what i did except that it didn't work)
the1whoscreams: oh. door stuck. that's. bad
prinx_e_umlaut: ab fuvg fureybpx
prinx_e_umlaut: ...fbeel, gung jnf ehqr

voldllght: Yes, the door does appear to be stuck
prinx_e_umlaut: yrgf whfg fnl vg jnf onq.
voldllght: I have no idea what you are saying
the1whoscreams: yeah but usually that works
voldllght: Maccus save us
voldllght: what do you mean glue
voldllght: okay who put the gorilla glue in the doorframe
defensive_lobster: Okay okay so. Just keep calm and keep hydrated right? Surely Maccus can save us, it's not like one God already failed at that or anything haha
defensive_lobster: Just uhm. Drink some water or something? turns the bathtub faucet on
prinx_e_umlaut: *jumps out of the bathtub, hissing* qb lbh jnag zr gb QEBJA?!
defensive_lobster: See? Doing better already!
defensive_lobster: Actually I realized we can just drown ourselves to die! So we don't have to suffer an eternity in here. Theoretically. Wait.. shit, lobsters can breather underwater.
eldritchcorvus: *crow stares at DL. A bit angry at this but cools off. His long elf like ears flicking from this*
prinx_e_umlaut: bxnl, lbh qb jnag zr gb qebja, terrrng.
defensive_lobster: Look may as well take the scientific approach, right? See if death is possible, which one of us can breathe underwater, if there's a limited water supply, maybe we can flood this whole room, gotta have some fun before we go totally insane and all
eldritchcorvus: I can die but if I do I do have my own respawn mechanic. Got to destroy my body comepeltely and disarm my timer to let me respawn elsewhere

the1whoscreams: this better not end up like that one lost anime
the1whoscreams: we do not need to speedrun re-enacting saki sanobashi in the catalyst's bathroom
jadedResearcher: man theres way more eternity to go before we snap
jadedResearcher: cheer up
jadedResearcher: i vote we try to tear the shower curtain down and wear it as a robe
eldritchcorvus: don't you know how long it takes mortals of waiting before they jump to illogical decisions?
jadedResearcher: negative time but thats not the same as snapping
jadedResearcher: its surprisingly hard to break a mind
jadedResearcher: actually the illogic is part of why
eldritchcorvus: yeah but then again we barely have anything to do here asides from possible self harm. It's not like there's a way to the back roo- and Crow then noclips through the floor
the1whoscreams: oh okay
voldllght: Friends rejoice, I have gotten Shrek 2 to work.
the1whoscreams: nice
jadedResearcher: oh shit
jadedResearcher: yes
jadedResearcher: lets watch shrek 2
jadedResearcher: 'i thought love was only true in fairy tales"
jadedResearcher: i have that shit memorized
jadedResearcher: i watched it like 60 times one summer against my will
jadedResearcher: what better way to pass the time while trapped
voldllght: Perfect
eldritchcorvus: arms are rising from the noclip area in the floor. Ones from Crow likely trying to fleshwarp himself back up into the bathroom
defensive_lobster: Okay, who all wants to wear the curtain robes?
jadedResearcher: i think the catalyst should
jadedResearcher: to prove they own the toilet
defensive_lobster: Sorry, the cat ate it, right prinxe
prinx_e_umlaut: v qvq abg qb gung. *tail swishes at the curtain which is clearly still right there*
voldllght: Damn Shrek 2 was longer than I remembered
defensive_lobster: Hey guys? I forgot to turn the bathtub faucet off. We are kiinda flooded now.
jadedResearcher: see and you worried you'd be bored with eternity
jadedResearcher: pool party
defensive_lobster: It's taken me several days of fierce battle, but I finally ripped the shower curtain off! It's still a bit burned tho.
the1whoscreams: sick
jadedResearcher: all hail the lobster!
eldritchcorvus: from the backrooms under the bathroom and the hands of Crow which are noclipped above the floor All hail The Lobster
voldllght: Oh shit, yall I forgot I had Inscryption on this thing. Never played it, let me set up the audio and graphics shit. Should be ready by, lets say tomorrow around 3 PM PST
voldllght: ((Yes this is an in character reminder about the very real ooc Inscryption stream
un.heimlich: Oooo that sounds fun, I haven't finished it yet but I've really enjoyed it so far
jadedResearcher: inscryption is genuinely one of the best games ive ever played
jadedResearcher: on my end i finally have all the moving parts needed to simulate this bathroom while we're in this bathroom
voldllght: Oh hell yeah
eldritchcorvus: Oh heck yeah. Also please help my body is warped against it's will in the liminal space I fell to and cannot get out. Even with my arms sticking out of the floor
defensive_lobster: Actually I think that's why we haven't drowned yet, the water keeps pouring out through the liminal hole in our floor, otherwise we'd be flooded
defensive_lobster: Who knew the hotel had an infinite water supply?
jadedResearcher: its important to be hydrated :)
jadedResearcher: think of it this way
jadedResearcher: WE arent stuck here
jadedResearcher: everyone ELSE is stuck out there
jadedResearcher: they will never experience how great this bathroom is
voldllght: True!
eldritchcorvus: well yes but still I'm stuck as in I cannot move. I just want to be in one room
maoushoujoella: Image
jadedResearcher: bathroomception!!!
jadedResearcher: hey everybody, smile, i'm taking a picture :) :) :)
voldllght: :D
Moccus: :o]
eldritchcorvus: crow's face is not going to be in the pic but his many arms here dark red and all with a single green eye can be in the pic. The arms work together to form a smile with the hands
defensive_lobster: :o)
maoushoujoella: Image
jadedResearcher: fun fact, no we cannot leave :) :) :)
jadedResearcher: but thats okay
jadedResearcher: bathrooms are as big as the universe
jadedResearcher: which is great
jadedResearcher: because otherwise
jadedResearcher: with 11 of us in here
jadedResearcher: you'd think we'd get cramped
voldllght: Indeed, lots of fun!
jadedResearcher: it begins
voldllght: :O
defensive_lobster: Could I receive some directions to the place that Has Begun please?
jadedResearcher: http://farragofiction.com/CatalystsBathroomSim/bathroom.html
jadedResearcher:  Once the simulation of the simulation is complete, we ALL can enjoy it :) :) :)
voldllght: oh my god that looks amazing
defensive_lobster: Oh god, now people can steal my simulated^2 toilet
jadedResearcher: actually :) :) :)
jadedResearcher: in deference to your position
jadedResearcher: no matter what happens
jadedResearcher: only the LobsterSim can have the porcelain throne
voldllght: damn
jadedResearcher: of course who could say what would happen on the edges of reality
defensive_lobster: Whoah
defensive_lobster: I am honored, this is amazing
voldllght: There goes my simulated plans for the weekend
defensive_lobster: let the games of throne begin
maoushoujoella: Image
defensive_lobster: why does the personality always find new hidden stuff first smh
jadedResearcher: right?
jadedResearcher: anyways the maze will be available later today i'm thinking
tiredturbulence: this bathroom has become such a Thing and i did not expect that hehe
jadedResearcher: our commitment to the Bathroom Gang is rewarded :)
jadedResearcher: didnt get the simulation finished yesterday, but today or tomorrow for def
jadedResearcher: lol
jadedResearcher: i just realized
jadedResearcher: the personality hacked it
jadedResearcher: to steal the porcelain throne
defensive_lobster: PERSONALITY IM GOING TO FLUSH YOU
eldritchcorvus: Flush! Flush! Flush! Flush! Flush!
voldllght: Flush the apostate!!!
jadedResearcher: <i style="padding:30px;">"defensive_lobster:Okay okay calm down, look. Some of us went through gopher before, right? This is just like that, just... in one room. With no way out. Not even exploration to keep us busy, yeah this is fine, hahahahaahahaah. Hah"</i>
jadedResearcher: the sheer irony
jadedResearcher: the horseshoes
jadedResearcher: i didn't remember this line when i had my inspiration
jadedResearcher: but it must have infected my brain
jadedResearcher: it has come to my attention
jadedResearcher: that a non trivial amoutn of us
jadedResearcher: have seen maccus in here
jadedResearcher: show of hands
