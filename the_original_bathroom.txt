<b>JR:</b> guys guys guys, check this out
<b>JR:</b> why does the catalyst get TWO sinks
<b>prinx_e_umlaut:</b> wait, what does not being in the bathroom have to do with performing capitalism
<b>defensive_lobster:</b> *sits on the closed toilet*
<b>defensive_lobster:</b> Ladies, gentlemen and other specimen. It appears we are stuck.
<b>prinx_e_umlaut:</b> why do you get two sinks<
<b>defensive_lobster:</b> Now, you may be asking, "how in the hell is it possible to get stuck here? The command to leave through the door was right there!"
<b>defensive_lobster:</b> Wellll, the : </b>is stuck. Just straight up decided the door doesn't exist. So we are, quite literally, stuck in a room with no connections to anywhere in this microcosmos. All we have is a toilet, a shower curtain that can't be moved for some reason? And yes, thank you prinxe, two whole sinks.
<b>defensive_lobster:</b> If anybody has any ideas, please come forth and sit on the throne. *hops off the toilet*
<b>prinx_e_umlaut: </b>*squeezes into the small space between the unmovable curtain and the wall and sits down in the bathtub* Meow.
<b>eldritchcorvus: </b>how the fuck are we stuck? You have a fucking god with you. Watch me punch this wall down
<b>eldritchcorvus:*Crow then goes to try and punch down the wall but despite his godly strength he fails to do anything but break his hand. Screaming in pain as all of it's bones are broken in a comedic slapstick manner*
<b>voldllght:*stands up on the closed toilet*
<b>voldllght: </b>I propose, we dub the shower The Third Sink.
<b>eldritchcorvus: </b> What. Sure it functions like a sink but larger but why call it a sink when it's purpose is different?
<b>voldllght: </b>I think three sinks would be cool
<b>prinx_e_umlaut: </b>*calls out from behind the curtain* sure, that makes as much sense as anything
<b>prinx_e_umlaut: </b>Meow.
<b>voldllght: </b>Then it is settled. Also I have no damn clue on how we're getting out
<b>eldritchcorvus: </b>Yeah and I'm a god. I just hope it's just a liminal space not any punishment directly at me
<b>eldritchcorvus: </b>*Crow is a anthro dragon of pale skin colored scales. 6 purple eyes and is 7'5. He fits within this room but barley as he has to bend over his 1 foot of dragon neck to stay within the room*
<b>defensive_lobster: </b>I... am glad we're staying occupied with important discussions about sinks and showers. We do have literally all the time in eternity I think? So how about we start asking some questions
<b>defensive_lobster: </b>Such as
<b>defensive_lobster: </b>WHY ARE THERE 20 OF YOU IN MY FUCKING BATHROOM
<b>defensive_lobster: </b>seriously, the sleepover ended TWO WEEKS AGO
<b>prinx_e_umlaut: </b>isnt it obvious? im a cat, i go where i want
<b>voldllght: </b>I liked the curtain color, and was enchanted by its majesty.
<b>un.heimlich: </b>Do any of you have any hamburgers or anything left ðŸ˜­ I think we're running out of food
<b>voldllght: </b>I uh, I ate all my food during the sleepover.
<b>defensive_lobster: </b>FAN-FRICKING-TASTIC
<b>defensive_lobster: </b>On one hand, luckily I don't think we need food, just hydration. And water seems to be mysteriously still running, which gives us a bigger problem: </b>we're gonna go insane sooner than die. YAAAY.
<b>voldllght: </b>Funny of you to assume some of us arent already insane
<b>defensive_lobster: </b>Okay okay calm down, look. Some of us went through gopher before, right? This is just like that, just... in one room. With no way out. Not even exploration to keep us busy, yeah this is fine, hahahahaahahaah. Hah
<b>eldritchcorvus: </b>I'm a god. I also got lost on my way to the elevator
<b>voldllght: </b>We could play eye-spy, Ill go first. I spy with my little eye something white.
<b>defensive_lobster: </b>The bedsheet KR is wearing! Or... wait I think they just ARE a sentient bedsheet.
<b>voldllght: </b>Correct!
<b>eldritchcorvus: </b>There's not a lot of space here and I am unsure if my powers even work here. If I can't get us to escape I would probably try to warp the bathroom larger. Yet there the wall contains no bodies or machines and the walls are unbreakable
<b>un.heimlich: </b>We've gotta be able to get out of here eventually :stressed: </b>right?? :stressed: </b>:stressed: </b>the door will start working again any minute now :stressed: </b>:stressed: </b>:stressed:
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>bold of you to assume talking to each other isn't exploration
<b>eldritchcorvus: </b>I hope so. but then again our fates are known. I just hope this does not become love town
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>infinite branching dialog
<b>defensive_lobster: </b>What do YOU know, you're stuck here just like all of us JR
<b>voldllght: </b>WAIT
<b>voldllght: </b>I brought my laptop
<b>voldllght: </b>we can game
<b>eldritchcorvus: </b>does it have battery?
<b>voldllght: </b>For now, someone find me an outlet. There's usually one in hotel bathrooms for hairdryers and such
<b>un.heimlich: </b>Ooo video game night with the Bathroom Brigade
<b>un.heimlich: </b>Bathroom Bros
<b>un.heimlich: </b>Bathroom Buddies
<b>eldritchcorvus: </b>Uhh... I don't think there's an outlet here. if there was one I would of warped it into a way out. Also if tat thing has batteries you better try to contact the outside with it
<b>un.heimlich: </b>Bathroom bunch...
<b>prinx_e_umlaut: </b>*from behind the shower curtain* you can try sticking the fork in me, i can generate power
<b>voldllght: </b>I would but uh, the only thing I can get to work on this internet is the <a href='http://lavinraca.eyedolgames.com/Week1/' target="_blank">booking</a> site for the hotel
<b>eldritchcorvus: </b>Ok that's strange. Was hoping for an easy escape like that
<b>prinx_e_umlaut: </b>huh. lets see
<b>voldllght: </b>As if we would be so fortunate
<b>prinx_e_umlaut: </b>*phases out and then immediately back in with a garbled sound effect; if anyone were to peek behind the shower curtain, theyd see me being way more frazzled after that*
<b>un.heimlich: </b>What happened? ðŸ˜³
<b>eldritchcorvus: </b>What the- what did you just do?
<b>voldllght: </b>what- what happened, did they do something?
<b>prinx_e_umlaut: </b>hu, ab, vg jnf whfg na vaperqvoyl onq vqrn, hu.
<b>un.heimlich: </b>I see I see
<b>voldllght: </b>That cant be good
<b>eldritchcorvus: </b>*for Crow this is an ancient language as he speaks it back to the cat who once vanished in here Jung qb lbh zrna vg'f na vaperqvoyl onq vgrz?*
<b>voldllght: </b>okay now they are :h doing it

<b>prinx_e_umlaut: </b>gurerf abg ernyyl zhpu ryfr gb fnl
<b>voldllght: </b>Im just, going to see what I can get to work on this internet.
<b>prinx_e_umlaut: </b>*sparks start flying off the cat, one of them making a small, but not tiny, hole in the shower curtain*
<b>un.heimlich: </b>Have you tried seeing if you can contact one of the butlers from the website that aren't in this bathroom? Maybe they can help get us out
<b>voldllght: </b>Yeah, seems to be a no go.
<b>voldllght: </b>I did however get youtube to somewhat work, no comment section, and none of the upload functions seem to work. But we have all of Vsauce.
<b>the1whoscreams: </b>(i approach the door and do something with my hand. it is unclear exactly what i did except that it didn't work)
<b>the1whoscreams: </b>oh. door stuck. that's. bad
<b>prinx_e_umlaut: </b>ab fuvg fureybpx
<b>prinx_e_umlaut: </b>...fbeel, gung jnf ehqr

<b>voldllght: </b>Yes, the door does appear to be stuck
<b>prinx_e_umlaut: </b>yrgf whfg fnl vg jnf onq.
<b>voldllght: </b>I have no idea what you are saying
<b>the1whoscreams: </b>yeah but usually that works
<b>voldllght: </b>Maccus save us
<b>voldllght: </b>what do you mean glue
<b>voldllght: </b>okay who put the gorilla glue in the doorframe
<b>defensive_lobster: </b>Okay okay so. Just keep calm and keep hydrated right? Surely Maccus can save us, it's not like one God already failed at that or anything haha
<b>defensive_lobster: </b>Just uhm. Drink some water or something? turns the bathtub faucet on
<b>prinx_e_umlaut: </b>*jumps out of the bathtub, hissing* qb lbh jnag zr gb QEBJA?!
<b>defensive_lobster: </b>See? Doing better already!
<b>defensive_lobster: </b>Actually I realized we can just drown ourselves to die! So we don't have to suffer an eternity in here. Theoretically. Wait.. shit, lobsters can breather underwater.
<b>eldritchcorvus: </b>*crow stares at DL. A bit angry at this but cools off. His long elf like ears flicking from this*
<b>prinx_e_umlaut: </b>bxnl, lbh qb jnag zr gb qebja, terrrng.
<b>defensive_lobster: </b>Look may as well take the scientific approach, right? See if death is possible, which one of us can breathe underwater, if there's a limited water supply, maybe we can flood this whole room, gotta have some fun before we go totally insane and all
<b>eldritchcorvus: </b>I can die but if I do I do have my own respawn mechanic. Got to destroy my body comepeltely and disarm my timer to let me respawn elsewhere

<b>the1whoscreams: </b>this better not end up like that one lost anime
<b>the1whoscreams: </b>we do not need to speedrun re-enacting saki sanobashi in the catalyst's bathroom
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>man theres way more eternity to go before we snap
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>cheer up
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>i vote we try to tear the shower curtain down and wear it as a robe
<b>eldritchcorvus: </b>don't you know how long it takes mortals of waiting before they jump to illogical decisions?
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>negative time but thats not the same as snapping
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>its surprisingly hard to break a mind
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>actually the illogic is part of why
<b>eldritchcorvus: </b>yeah but then again we barely have anything to do here asides from possible self harm. It's not like there's a way to the back roo- and Crow then noclips through the floor
<b>the1whoscreams: </b>oh okay
<b>voldllght: </b>Friends rejoice, I have gotten Shrek 2 to work.
<b>the1whoscreams: </b>nice
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>oh shit
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>yes
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>lets watch shrek 2
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>'i thought love was only true in fairy tales"
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>i have that shit memorized
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>i watched it like 60 times one summer against my will
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>what better way to pass the time while trapped
<b>voldllght: </b>Perfect
<b>eldritchcorvus: </b>arms are rising from the noclip area in the floor. Ones from Crow likely trying to fleshwarp himself back up into the bathroom
<b>defensive_lobster: </b>Okay, who all wants to wear the curtain robes?
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>i think the catalyst should
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>to prove they own the toilet
<b>defensive_lobster: </b>Sorry, the cat ate it, right prinxe
<b>prinx_e_umlaut: </b>v qvq abg qb gung. *tail swishes at the curtain which is clearly still right there*
<b>voldllght: </b>Damn Shrek 2 was longer than I remembered
<b>defensive_lobster: </b>Hey guys? I forgot to turn the bathtub faucet off. We are kiinda flooded now.
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>see and you worried you'd be bored with eternity
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>pool party
<b>defensive_lobster: </b>It's taken me several days of fierce battle, but I finally ripped the shower curtain off! It's still a bit burned tho.
<b>the1whoscreams: </b>sick
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>all hail the lobster!
<b>eldritchcorvus: </b>from the backrooms under the bathroom and the hands of Crow which are noclipped above the floor All hail The Lobster
<b>voldllght: </b>Oh shit, yall I forgot I had Inscryption on this thing. Never played it, let me set up the audio and graphics shit. Should be ready by, lets say tomorrow around 3 PM PST
<b>voldllght: </b>((Yes this is an in character reminder about the very real ooc Inscryption stream
<b>un.heimlich: </b>Oooo that sounds fun, I haven't finished it yet but I've really enjoyed it so far
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>inscryption is genuinely one of the best games ive ever played
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>on my end i finally have all the moving parts needed to simulate this bathroom while we're in this bathroom
<b>voldllght: </b>Oh hell yeah
<b>eldritchcorvus: </b>Oh heck yeah. Also please help my body is warped against it's will in the liminal space I fell to and cannot get out. Even with my arms sticking out of the floor
<b>defensive_lobster: </b>Actually I think that's why we haven't drowned yet, the water keeps pouring out through the liminal hole in our floor, otherwise we'd be flooded
<b>defensive_lobster: </b>Who knew the hotel had an infinite water supply?
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>its important to be hydrated :)
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>think of it this way
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>WE arent stuck here
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>everyone ELSE is stuck out there
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>they will never experience how great this bathroom is
<b>voldllght: </b>True!
<b>eldritchcorvus: </b>well yes but still I'm stuck as in I cannot move. I just want to be in one room
<b>maoushoujoella: </b>Image
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>bathroomception!!!
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>hey everybody, smile, i'm taking a picture :) :) :)
<b>voldllght: </b>:D
<b>Moccus: </b>:o]
<b>eldritchcorvus: </b>crow's face is not going to be in the pic but his many arms here dark red and all with a single green eye can be in the pic. The arms work together to form a smile with the hands
<b>defensive_lobster: </b>:o)
<b>maoushoujoella: </b>Image
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>fun fact, no we cannot leave :) :) :)
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>but thats okay
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>bathrooms are as big as the universe
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>which is great
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>because otherwise
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>with 11 of us in here
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>you'd think we'd get cramped
<b>voldllght: </b>Indeed, lots of fun!
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>it begins
<b>voldllght: </b>:O
<b>defensive_lobster: </b>Could I receive some directions to the place that Has Begun please?
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>http://farragofiction.com/CatalystsBathroomSim/bathroom.html
<b>jadedResearcher: </b> Once the simulation of the simulation is complete, we ALL can enjoy it :) :) :)
<b>voldllght: </b>oh my god that looks amazing
<b>defensive_lobster: </b>Oh god, now people can steal my simulated^2 toilet
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>actually :) :) :)
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>in deference to your position
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>no matter what happens
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>only the LobsterSim can have the porcelain throne
<b>voldllght: </b>damn
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>of course who could say what would happen on the edges of reality
<b>defensive_lobster: </b>Whoah
<b>defensive_lobster: </b>I am honored, this is amazing
<b>voldllght: </b>There goes my simulated plans for the weekend
<b>defensive_lobster: </b>let the games of throne begin
<b>maoushoujoella: </b>Image
<b>defensive_lobster: </b>why does the personality always find new hidden stuff first smh
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>right?
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>anyways the maze will be available later today i'm thinking
<b>tiredturbulence: </b>this bathroom has become such a Thing and i did not expect that hehe
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>our commitment to the Bathroom Gang is rewarded :)
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>didnt get the simulation finished yesterday, but today or tomorrow for def
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>lol
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>i just realized
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>the personality hacked it
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>to steal the porcelain throne
<b>defensive_lobster: </b>PERSONALITY IM GOING TO FLUSH YOU
<b>eldritchcorvus: </b>Flush! Flush! Flush! Flush! Flush!
<b>voldllght: </b>Flush the apostate!!!
<b>jadedResearcher: </b><i style="padding:30px;">"defensive_lobster:Okay okay calm down, look. Some of us went through gopher before, right? This is just like that, just... in one room. With no way out. Not even exploration to keep us busy, yeah this is fine, hahahahaahahaah. Hah"</i>
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>the sheer irony
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>the horseshoes
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>i didn't remember this line when i had my inspiration
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>but it must have infected my brain
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>it has come to my attention
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>that a non trivial amoutn of us
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>have seen maccus in here
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>show of hands
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>whose seen them
<b>tiredturbulence: </b>ðŸ‘‹ me i think
<b>voldllght: </b>Hello I have!
<b>the1whoscreams: </b>i have
<b>un.heimlich:</b> I think so?? At some point? Could be a false memory on my part though
<b>prinx_e_umlaut:</b> *raises paw*
<b>prinx_e_umlaut:</b> :O
<b>defensive_lobster:</b> I have as well. Glad to see prinxe isn't completely broken btw!
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>iiiiinteresting
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>well
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>you'll see what i mean once the simulation is ready
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>we can all finally compare notes
<b>jadedResearcher: </b>light pierces the void etc etc
